# Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection

## Overview
This project implements a **hybrid detection framework** for identifying vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts. It combines **signature-based detection** with **machine learning classification** to improve security analysis.

## Features
- **Signature-Based Detection**: Identifies known vulnerabilities using predefined patterns.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Uses a **Random Forest classifier** optimized with **GridSearchCV**.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Merges both methods to enhance accuracy and recall.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/orekeeweee/smart-contracts.git
   cd repository
